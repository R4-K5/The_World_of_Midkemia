    <h1>The World of Midkemia</h1>

    <hr>

    <div class="content-section">
        <p>Welcome, adventurer, to Midkemia, a world of ancient magic, sprawling kingdoms, shadowy intrigues, and epic tales. This guide is designed to prepare you for The World of Midkemia a campaign set in the aftermath of the great Riftwar, a time of uneasy peace and stirring shadows. Herein, you will find information about the world, its gods, and unique options to shape your character for the adventures that lie ahead.</p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <div class="content-section">
        <p>The land bears the scars of past conflicts, and the echoes of powerful magic still resonate. While an uneasy peace holds, new threats gather in the shadows, and the deeds of heroes will once again be needed to safeguard the realms of mortals.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Setting: Midkemia After the Riftwar</h2>

    <hr>

    <div class="content-section">
        <p>Decades have passed since the otherworldly Tsurani Empire first breached the fabric of reality, their rift gate opening a path of invasion into the heart of the Kingdom of the Isles. The long and bitter Riftwar that followed reshaped nations, forged unlikely heroes, and left indelible scars upon the land and its people. Though the rifts were eventually sealed and an uneasy truce established with the Tsurani, the echoes of that conflict still resonate.</p>
        <p>Magic, once the domain of reclusive sorcerers and ancient elves, became a more visible, if force still feared by some. The knowledge of other worlds, other powers, and the terrifying fragility of reality itself now lingers in the minds of scholars and rulers. The Kingdom of the Isles, though victorious, remains vigilant, its borders hardened, its cities ever watchful.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>The Kingdom of the Isles</h3>
    <div class="content-section">
        <p>The dominant human nation of Midkemia, ruled from the capital city of Rillanon by King Rodric IV. It is a vast realm of diverse duchies (like Yabon and Crydee), baronies, and free cities, each with its own character and concerns. While the Kingdom enjoys a period of relative peace, internal politics can be fractious, border skirmishes with Kesh or northern tribes are not uncommon, and ancient threats sometimes stir from forgotten corners.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Krondor: Jewel of the West</h3>
    <div class="content-section">
        <p>The traditional seat of the Prince of Krondor (currently Prince Arutha conDoin, the King's brother), heir to the throne, and the most important city in the Western Realm. It is a sprawling port city on the Bitter Sea, a melting pot of cultures, a vital hub of trade, and a notorious den of intrigue.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High Quarter:</strong> Home to noble estates and opulent palaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Merchant Quarter:</strong> Bustling with commerce and guildhalls.</li>
            <li><strong>Temple Quarter:</strong> Where the city's major temples stand.</li>
            <li><strong>Poor Quarter &amp; Fishtown:</strong> Teeming, rougher districts near the docks.</li>
            <li><strong>Tannery Row (Stinktown):</strong> Known for its noxious fumes and less savory elements.</li>
            <li><strong>The Mockers' Hole:</strong> The traditional heart of Krondor's Thieves' Guild, though its power has waxed and waned.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Krondor is a city of stark contrasts, where fortunes are made, secrets are buried, and danger often lurks beneath a veneer of civilization. The Crown's Eyes, the Prince's intelligence network, operate from the shadows here, ever vigilant.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Kelewan and the Tsurani Empire</h3>
    <div class="content-section">
        <p>Across the now-sealed rifts lies Kelewan, homeworld of the Tsurani. A rigid, honor-bound empire dominated by powerful warrior houses (like the Acoma, Anasati, Shinzawai) and the enigmatic Assembly of Magicians who wield Path Magic, the Tsurani are an alien and often misunderstood culture. Their society is vastly different from that of the Kingdom. Though official peace exists, suspicion and curiosity linger on both sides. Tsurani artifacts, and the echoes of their unique magic (often involving the manipulation of Paths or dimensional energies through their language, Natal), can still be found in Midkemia, often sources of great power or great peril.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>The North &amp; The Moredhel</h3>
    <div class="content-section">
        <p>To the north of the Kingdom lie the rugged Grey Towers, the icy Teeth of the World, and the vast, untamed forests and mountains that are home to the <strong>Moredhel</strong> – the Dark Elves or Brothers of Darkness. Ancient kin to the golden-skinned elves of Elvandar (the Eledhel), the Moredhel chose a different, darker path long ago, embracing a more brutal existence and sometimes consorting with dark powers. They harbor a deep-seated enmity with the Kingdom. They are fierce warriors, skilled survivalists, and an unpredictable force on the northern frontier. Not all Moredhel are inherently evil; many are simply trying to survive in harsh lands or adhere to ancient, often grim, traditions. However, warlords often arise among them, seeking to unite the clans and wage war upon the south.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>A Note on Magic &amp; Technology</h3>
    <div class="content-section">
        <p>Midkemia is a world where magic is real but not always commonplace for the average peasant. Great sorcerers like Pug of Stardock are figures of legend, but lesser forms of magic are practiced by guild mages, temple priests, and elven spell-weavers. Technology is largely pre-industrial, akin to medieval Europe, with skilled artisans, alchemists, and smiths. Gunpowder is virtually unknown, and advanced machinery is rare, though clever clockwork devices or formidable siege engines are not unheard of, especially from skilled dwarven.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Deities of Midkemia</h2>
    <div class="content-section">
        <p>The Pantheon of Midkemia is diverse, with gods representing many aspects of life, death, and the cosmos. While characters may worship any deity appropriate to their background, the following are particularly relevant to the themes and potential conflicts within The World of Midkemia</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ishap, God of Balance:</strong> The Unseen Fulcrum, Ishap represents the great balance between all forces – light and dark, order and chaos, creation and destruction. His followers are often quiet philosophers, mediators, or guardians who strive to prevent any single power from gaining ultimate ascendancy. His temples are places of serene contemplation.</li>
            <li><strong>Astalon, God of Justice and Retribution:</strong> The Just God, Astalon embodies righteous law, unwavering judgment, and swift retribution against the guilty. His paladins and priests are often grim, determined figures who hunt down criminals, expose corruption, and ensure that all, regardless of station, face the consequences of their actions.</li>
            <li><strong>Lims-Kragma, Goddess of Death and the Passage of Souls:</strong> Often feared as the Harbinger of the End, Lims-Kragma also represents the natural cycle of life and death, the peaceful transition of souls, and the quiet dignity of winter's rest. Her true priests, the Soul Shepherds, minister to the dying, ensure proper rites, and stand as vigilant guardians against undeath and those who would unnaturally prolong suffering.</li>
            <li><strong>Sung, the White God, God of Light, Healing, and Purity:</strong> Sung represents hope, compassion, and the unwavering light that pushes back the shadows. His priests are often healers, protectors of the innocent, and champions against darkness and despair. The Oracle at the High Temple of Sung in Krondor is a source of cryptic but potent prophecy.</li>
            <li><strong>Narlor, the Unseen, God of Secrets, Shadows, and the Night:</strong> One of the Lesser Dark Gods, Narlor revels in hidden knowledge, deception, and the subtle manipulation of events from behind the scenes. His followers are often spies, assassins (like some Nighthawk factions), and those who seek power through forbidden lore and clandestine means. He is a master of intrigue and the patron of those who thrive in darkness.</li>
            <li><strong>Sarangrave, the Spider Queen (Often considered an aspect of Narlor or another Dark God):</strong> A malevolent deity of chaos, spiders, poison, and predatory deceit. Her cults often operate in secret, weaving webs of intrigue and performing dark rituals to gain her favor and spread her venomous influence.</li>
            <li><strong>Dahak, the Star-Devourer (A Greater Dark God):</strong> An ancient, almost forgotten entity of pure destruction and cosmic annihilation. Unlike gods who seek worship or dominion, Dahak desires only the unmaking of all things. His influence is rarely felt directly but can manifest through catastrophic events, the rise of nihilistic doomsday cults, and the emergence of monstrous heralds when the barriers between worlds weaken.</li>
            <li><strong>The Tsurani Great Ones:</strong> The Tsurani do not worship gods in the Midkemian sense but revere powerful, almost god-like entities known as the Great Ones (e.g., Turakam, God of War; Hantukama, Lord of a Thousand Eyes). These beings embody aspects of Tsurani philosophy and power, and some Tsurani individuals might draw magical strength from a connection to them.</li>

    <h3><strong>BARBARIAN</strong></h3>
    <h4><strong>Barbarian Path: Path of the Shadowed Peak</strong></h4>
    <div class="content-section">
        <p><em>(Warriors who walk the Path of the Shadowed Peak are children of the unforgiving North, whether Moredhel hardened by generations of strife and communion with harsh nature, or humans from the borderland clans who have adopted the brutal ways necessary for survival against both the elements and ancient foes...)</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Level 3: Mountain's Resilience &amp; Shadowed Step</strong></p>
        <p>When you choose this path at 3rd level:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mountain's Resilience:</strong> Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your barbarian level when you adopt this path, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. Additionally, you gain resistance to <strong>cold damage</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Shadowed Step:</strong> While you are raging, if you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to take the Hide action. Furthermore, while raging, you can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by shadows, rocky terrain, or dense foliage.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 6: Ambush Predator</strong></p>
        <p>Starting at 6th level:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on the first turn of combat, and you rolled higher than that creature for initiative, that attack deals an extra <strong>1d10 damage</strong> of the weapon's type.</li>
            <li>Additionally, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while in mountain, arctic, or forest terrain. When you make a Wisdom (Survival) check to track creatures in these terrains, your proficiency bonus is doubled for that check if it isn't already.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 10: Unyielding Heart of Stone</strong></p>
        <p>At 10th level:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>While raging, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, or magically put to sleep.</li>
            <li><strong>Stone's Endurance:</strong> If you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points while you are raging, you can use your reaction to delay that incapacitation. You immediately gain temporary hit points equal to your barbarian level + your Constitution modifier, and you remain conscious. If you are still at 0 hit points when these temporary hit points are gone, you fall unconscious as normal. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 14: Fury of the North Wind</strong></p>
        <p>Starting at 14th level, when you enter your rage, or as a bonus action on a subsequent turn while raging, you can unleash a blast of chilling, spiritual fury reminiscent of a northern blizzard.</p>
        <p>Each creature of your choice within a 15-foot cone originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failed save, a creature takes <strong>cold damage equal to twice your barbarian level</strong> and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn as spectral frost and biting winds momentarily encase it. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and its speed is not reduced.</p>
        <p>You can use this feature once per rage.</p>

    <h4><strong>Barbarian Path: Path of the Valheru Echo (Revised)</strong></h4>
    <div class="content-section">
        <p><em>(You are a living conduit for a power that once shattered mountains and made dragons tremble – the primal fury of the Valheru, the Dragon Lords of old...)</em></p>

        <p><strong>Level 3: Echo of Fury</strong></p>
        <p>When you choose this path at 3rd level, the primal energy of the Valheru surges through you when you rage. When you enter your rage, choose one of the following damage types: <strong>acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.</strong></p>
        <p>While you are raging, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a melee weapon attack takes an extra <strong>1d6 damage</strong> of the chosen type.</p>
        <p>The extra damage increases to <strong>2d6</strong> when you reach 10th level in this class.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 3: Draconic Resilience</strong></p>
        <p>The echo of the Dragon Lords fortifies your form. Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your barbarian level when you adopt this path (so, by 3 at 3rd level), and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.</p>
        <p>Additionally, while you are raging, you gain resistance to the damage type you selected for your Echo of Fury.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 6: Valheru's Might (Revised)</strong></p>
        <p>At 6th level, your connection to the Valheru's raw power deepens, granting you echoes of their legendary physical prowess. While raging:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled. This reflects a surge of superhuman strength.</li>
            <li>Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. This heightened ferocity channels the destructive potential of the Dragon Lords.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 10: Primal Roar</strong></p>
        <p>Starting at 10th level, you can unleash a terrifying roar imbued with the ancient power of the Valheru. As an action while you are raging, you can force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier).</p>
        <p>On a failed save, a creature is frightened of you for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
        <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. You can also expend one use of your rage to use this feature again.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 14: Ascendant Echo</strong></p>
        <p>At 14th level, the Valheru echo within you surges with near-overwhelming power, granting you a glimpse of true ascendancy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The extra damage from your <strong>Echo of Fury</strong> feature increases from 2d6 to <strong>3d6</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Unleashed Power:</strong> While raging, if you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points but not kill you outright, you can use your reaction to instead drop to 1 hit point. If you do, you immediately unleash a devastating burst of the elemental energy currently active for your Echo of Fury. Each creature (friend or foe) within 15 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). A creature takes elemental damage equal to <strong>three times your barbarian level</strong> on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After unleashing this power, your rage ends immediately, and you suffer one level of exhaustion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you use this reaction, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h3><strong>BARD</strong></h3>
    <h4><strong>Bard College: College of Heraldry</strong></h4>
    <div class="content-section">
        <p><em>(Bards of the College of Heraldry are more than mere minstrels or jesters; they are the living repositories of lineage, the arbiters of etiquette, and the subtle weavers of political discourse...)</em></p>

        <p><strong>Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies &amp; Herald's Voice</strong></p>
        <p>When you join the College of Heraldry at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the <strong>History</strong> and <strong>Persuasion</strong> skills. If you are already proficient in either skill, you can choose another skill from the Bard skill list. You also gain proficiency with <strong>Calligrapher's Supplies</strong>, which you can use as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</p>
        <p>Additionally, when you make a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Intimidation) check, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration, roll the die, and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the d20 but before the DM determines whether the ability check succeeds or fails.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 3: Sigil of Insight</strong></p>
        <p>Also at 3rd level, your deep understanding of symbols, lineage, and social structures grants you keen insight.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have advantage on Intelligence (History) checks related to heraldry, noble lineages, royal decrees, and the history of established organizations or kingdoms.</li>
            <li>As an action, you can focus on one humanoid creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the creature's Charisma (Deception) check. If you succeed, you learn one piece of useful, publicly knowable or historically recorded information about the creature's direct lineage, house affiliations, or significant social standing (e.g., They are the third son of Baron Valis of Tyr-Sog, Their family lost their lands during the Keshian border wars, They hold a significant rank within the Mercantyler's Guild). The DM determines the specific piece of information revealed. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 6: Rallying Oration</strong></p>
        <p>At 6th level, you can weave stirring words of courage and heritage to bolster your allies.</p>
        <p>When a creature (including yourself) uses one of your Bardic Inspiration dice by adding it to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to further empower them. The creature gains temporary hit points equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute.</p>
        <p>Additionally, if the roll they added your Bardic Inspiration to was a saving throw against being charmed or frightened, they make that saving throw with advantage.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 14: Proclamation of Power</strong></p>
        <p>At 14th level, you can imbue your pronouncements with significant magical authority. As an action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to issue a Proclamation. Choose one of the following effects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Edict of Sanctuary:</strong> You choose a point within 60 feet. You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of protective energy centered on that point that lasts for 1 minute. Any friendly creature that starts its turn within the sphere or enters it for the first time on a turn gains temporary hit points equal to your Bard level + your Charisma modifier. Additionally, attack rolls against creatures within the sphere have disadvantage.</li>
            <li><strong>Decree of Condemnation:</strong> You target one creature you can see within 60 feet and issue a powerful condemnation. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become vulnerable to one damage type of your choice (from bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, fire, cold, lightning, poison, or thunder) for 1 minute. Additionally, the target has disadvantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks for the duration. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you use either of these Proclamations, you cannot use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

        <p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. For the next minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), whenever that creature makes an attack roll or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus or a penalty (your choice at the time of the reaction) to that single roll equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1 or -1). You must declare you are using this reaction <em>before</em> the outcome of the d20 roll is known.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 6: Aegis of Impartiality</strong></p>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes damage from a spell or attack originating from an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage from that specific triggering instance by an amount equal to 1d10 + your cleric level.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 1: Bonus Proficiencies</strong></p>
        <p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, or Religion.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 1: Shepherd's Vigil</strong></p>
        <p>From 1st level, you learn the <em>Spare the Dying</em> cantrip if you don't already know it. For you, its range is 30 feet, and you can cast it as a bonus action.</p>
        <p>Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to detect undead creatures and on Wisdom (Insight) checks to discern if a creature you can see within 30 feet is close to death (if it has 0 hit points or fewer than a quarter of its maximum hit points remaining).</p>

        <p><strong>Level 2: Channel Divinity: Passage of Peace / Rebuke the Defilers</strong></p>
        <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity for one of the following effects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Passage of Peace:</strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol. Choose one willing creature within 30 feet of you that is at 0 hit points and dying, or a humanoid creature that has died within the last minute whose soul might linger. If the creature is dying, it immediately stabilizes and regains 1 hit point. If the creature is recently deceased, its soul is guided peacefully from the mortal coil, and it cannot be raised as an undead creature by any means short of a <em>Wish</em> spell for the next 24 hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Rebuke the Defilers:</strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol. Each undead creature or fiend within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 6: Guardian of Souls</strong></p>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, when you or a friendly creature within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to cause that creature to immediately drop to 1 hit point instead. The first time that creature takes any damage before the start of your next turn, it has resistance to that instance of damage.</p>
        <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 8: Divine Strike</strong></p>
        <p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold or necrotic damage (your choice) to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 17: Shepherd of the Lost Gate</strong></p>
        <p>At 17th level, you become a true conduit between life and death.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When you use your Passage of Peace Channel Divinity on a recently deceased humanoid, you can ask its departing spirit one question (as if you had cast <em>Speak with Dead</em>, requiring no material components). The spirit answers truthfully to the best of its knowledge before it passes on.</li>
            <li>When you deal radiant, cold, or necrotic damage with a cleric spell or your Divine Strike feature to an undead creature or a fiend, you can choose to deal maximum damage instead of rolling. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3><strong>DRUID</strong></h3>
    <h4><strong>Druid Circle: Circle of the Ancient Heartwood (Revised AC)</strong></h4>
    <div class="content-section">
        <p><em>(Druids of the Circle of the Ancient Heartwood are deeply bound to the oldest, most potent forests of Midkemia...)</em></p>

        <p><strong>Level 2: Child of the Sentinel Trees &amp; Bonus Cantrip</strong></p>
        <p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you are blessed by the ancient spirits of the forest.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bonus Cantrip:</strong> You learn the <em>Shillelagh</em> cantrip. This does not count against the number of druid cantrips you know. For you, when you cast <em>Shillelagh</em>, the affected quarterstaff or club also gains the <strong>reach</strong> property (10 feet) if it did not already have it, as spectral, grasping branches momentarily extend from it when you attack.</li>
            <li><strong>Child of the Sentinel Trees:</strong> You gain proficiency in the <strong>Survival</strong> skill. Your innate connection to the ancient trees grants you an intuitive understanding of woodland environments. You can move through nonmagical difficult terrain made of plants (such as thickets, overgrown areas, grasping vines, or dense tree roots) without expending extra movement. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against being magically charmed or frightened by fey creatures or plant creatures, as the ancient woods shield your mind.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 2: Heartwood Ward (Revised for Shield Use)</strong></p>
        <p>Also at 2nd level, you can channel the protective essence of ancient wood. As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to weave vibrant, living woody fibers around yourself or one willing creature you can see within 30 feet.</p>
        <p>The target gains temporary hit points equal to <strong>five times your proficiency bonus</strong>.</p>
        <p>While these temporary hit points last, the target's skin takes on a tough, bark-like resilience. If the target is not wearing armor, its base Armor Class becomes <strong>10 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</strong>. This base Armor Class cannot be lower than 13. The target can benefit from wielding a shield in addition to this AC calculation if they are proficient with shields (adding the shield's normal AC bonus). If the target is wearing armor, they do not gain this AC calculation benefit but still receive the temporary hit points.</p>
        <p>The temporary hit points and any AC benefit from this feature last for 1 hour or until the temporary hit points are depleted.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 6: Voice of the Whispering Leaves</strong></p>
        <p>At 6th level, your bond with the plant kingdom deepens.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You learn to speak with plants as if you were constantly under the effects of the <em>Speak with Plants</em> spell. Plants that are not creatures typically convey simple information about recent events, such as the passage of creatures, weather conditions, or sources of sustenance or corruption nearby.</li>
            <li><strong>One with the Woods:</strong> You can use your action to touch one willing Beast or Plant creature and imbue it with a sliver of ancient sentience and the forest's resilience. For 1 hour, the creature's Intelligence and Wisdom scores become 10 (if they were lower), it understands one language of your choice that you speak (though it cannot speak unless it normally could), and it gains temporary hit points equal to twice your druid level. While it has these temporary hit points, it has advantage on Wisdom and Constitution saving throws. You can use this feature once, and regain the use of it after you finish a short or long rest.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 10: Ironwood Form</strong></p>
        <p>Starting at 10th level, your body can temporarily take on the unyielding hardness and resilience of ancient ironwood.</p>
        <p>When you are hit by an attack, or when you are forced to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage from an effect, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage (including magical forms of that damage) until the start of your next turn. While this resistance is active, your movement speed is reduced by 10 feet as your form becomes heavy and rigid.</p>
        <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 14: Aspect of the Forest Lord/Lady</strong></p>
        <p>At 14th level, you can fully embody the ancient might and majesty of the primordial forest. You can expend two uses of your Wild Shape at the same time to transform into an Aspect of the Ancient Heartwood for 10 minutes (or until you lose concentration, as if concentrating on a spell).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Your form becomes that of a Large plant creature, a majestic figure woven from living, ancient wood, intertwined with thorny vines, blooming flowers, and rustling leaves. Your eyes might glow with a soft green or amber light.</li>
            <li><strong>Statistics:</strong> Your game statistics, including your mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of a <strong>Treant</strong> (MM p. 289), except you retain your alignment, personality, hit points and Hit Dice, and your proficiency bonus. You also retain your skill proficiencies and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to those of the Treant. If the Treant's statistics are lower than yours for any ability score, you use your score instead. You cannot cast your druid spells in this form unless they lack somatic or material components that your new form cannot provide (you can provide verbal components with a voice like rustling leaves and creaking branches).</li>
            <li><strong>Abilities:</strong> While in this form, you gain the Treant's <strong>False Appearance</strong>, <strong>Siege Monster</strong> trait, and its <strong>Animate Trees</strong> action. When you use Animate Trees, the animated trees act on their own initiative count directly after yours, and you can mentally command them as a bonus action.</li>
            <li><strong>Reversion:</strong> You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h3><strong>FIGHTER</strong></h3>
    <h4><strong>Fighter Martial Archetype: Krondorian Sentinel (CON &amp; Gut Feeling Revision)</strong></h4>
    <div class="content-section">
        <p><em>(Krondorian Sentinels are the backbone of the Western Realm's defense, paragons of discipline forged in the rigorous training yards of the Krondor Garrison...)</em></p>

        <p><strong>Level 3: Sentinel's Training</strong></p>
        <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your rigorous Krondorian training and countless hours on watch have honed your instincts for impending danger and battlefield flow.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bonus Proficiencies:</strong> You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: <strong>Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, or Perception</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Battle-Honed Instincts:</strong> You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your <strong>Constitution</strong> modifier (minimum of +1). Additionally, you cannot be surprised while you are conscious, provided you are not incapacitated.</li>
            <li><strong>Intuitive Reposition:</strong> On your turn, if you take the Attack action, you can use your bonus action to signal an ally. One friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you can immediately use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks, guided by your instinctive read of the battle's ebb and flow.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 3: Shield of Krondor</strong></p>
        <p>Also at 3rd level, when you are wielding a shield, you can use it not only to protect yourself but to actively control engagements.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Warding Shield:</strong> While wielding a shield, your AC gains an additional +1 bonus.</li>
            <li><strong>Shield Bash:</strong> When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to make a special melee attack with your shield. If the attack hits, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, and you can choose one of the following effects:
                <ul>
                    <li>The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.</li>
                    <li>The target has disadvantage on its next attack roll against a creature other than you until the start of your next turn.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You can use this Shield Bash a number of times equal to your <strong>proficiency bonus</strong>, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Level 7: Hold the Line!</strong></p>
        <p>Starting at 7th level, your inspiring presence and sheer tenacity can turn the tide of battle.</p>
        <p>When you use your Second Wind feature, you can choose up to two friendly creatures (including yourself if desired) within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you. Each chosen creature gains temporary hit points equal to <strong>1d10 + your fighter level</strong> (these last for 10 minutes) and has advantage on the next saving throw they make within the next minute.</p>
        <p>Additionally, when an ally within 10 feet of you is forced to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to shout a visceral warning or make a bolstering gesture. That ally gains a bonus to their saving throw equal to your <strong>Constitution</strong> modifier (minimum of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 10: Krondorian Discipline</strong></p>
        <p>At 10th level, your ingrained discipline and unwavering spirit make you an unshakeable force on the battlefield.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.</li>
            <li><strong>Unbreakable Focus:</strong> Your sheer grit allows you to shrug off effects that would fell lesser warriors. If you fail a saving throw while you are conscious, you can choose to expend one use of your Indomitable feature (if available) to succeed instead. If you do not have a use of Indomitable available, or choose not to use it, you can expend 3 Hit Dice to succeed on the saving throw instead. When you expend Hit Dice in this way, you do not regain hit points from them; you are drawing upon your deepest reserves of stamina.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 15: Spearpoint of the Guard</strong></p>
        <p>Starting at 15th level, your instinctive leadership and combat prowess allow you to spearhead assaults or intercept critical threats with decisive impact.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lead the Charge:</strong> When you use your Action Surge feature, your surging vitality inspires those around you. You can choose a number of friendly creatures up to your <strong>Constitution</strong> modifier (minimum of one) within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you. Each chosen creature can immediately use its reaction to either move up to its speed <em>or</em> make one weapon attack.</li>
            <li><strong>Guardian's Intercept:</strong> If an enemy moves within 5 feet of an ally who is within your reach, your protective instincts flare. You can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that enemy. If you hit, the enemy's speed becomes 0 until the end of its current turn as your blow checks their advance, and the attack deals an extra 2d8 damage of the weapon's type.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Level 18: Bulwark of the West</strong></p>
        <p>At 18th level, you become an almost indomitable symbol of Krondor's strength and resilience, your very presence a bastion against despair.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your <strong>Warding Shield</strong> AC bonus (from the Shield of Krondor feature) increases to +2.</li>
            <li><strong>Indomitable Defense:</strong> At the start of each of your turns if you have no uses of your Indomitable feature left, your unyielding spirit grants you one use of Indomitable.</li>
            <li><strong>Rallying Cry:</strong> As a bonus action, you can unleash a powerful, gut-wrenching rallying cry, drawing upon your deepest reserves of courage and resolve. You and each friendly creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you regain hit points equal to your Fighter level, and each affected creature gains advantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the start of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3><strong>MONK</strong></h3>
    <h4><strong>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Unblinking Eye (Revised)</strong></h4>
    <div class="content-section">
        <p><em>(Monks of the Way of the Unblinking Eye are practitioners of an ancient and incredibly demanding martial discipline, its origins rooted in the rigid societal structures and focused philosophies of the Tsurani Empire on Kelewan...)</em></p>

        <p><strong>Level 3: Path of Discipline</strong></p>
        <p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your rigorous training begins to manifest.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: <strong>Acrobatics, Athletics, Insight, or Intimidation</strong>.</li>
            <li>You also gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice (such as Calligrapher's Supplies for practicing focus, or Woodcarver's Tools for crafting practice weapons) or one musical instrument that requires precise control (such as a Tsurani <em>shakuhachi</em>-like flute or a <em>koto</em>-like stringed instrument).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 3: Tsurani Combat Stance</strong></p>
        <p>Your intensive physical conditioning allows you to choose your method of defense and offense, embodying the diverse strengths found within Tsurani martial traditions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adapted Defense:</strong> When you adopt this tradition at 3rd level, you choose how your discipline manifests defensively. While you are not wearing any armor and not wielding a shield, your Armor Class can be calculated in one of the following ways (choose when you gain this feature):
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Standard Calculation:</strong> AC = 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strength Calculation:</strong> AC = 10 + your Strength modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Versatile Martial Arts:</strong> When making an attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon, you can use either your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 3: Tsurani Forms</strong></p>
        <p>Your martial arts training incorporates ancient, effective Tsurani techniques. When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can imbue each of the unarmed strikes you make as part of that Flurry with a special Ki-focus, choosing one of the following effects for each strike:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Focused Strike:</strong> The strike channels pure, concussive Ki. The strike deals an extra 1d4 force damage. This damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 17th level.</li>
            <li><strong>Disrupting Palm:</strong> If the strike hits, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) or have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn as you momentarily disrupt its Ki or vital energies.</li>
            <li><strong>Swift Step:</strong> After the strike hits or misses, you can immediately move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. This movement does not count against your normal movement speed for the turn.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Level 6: Mind Like Still Water</strong></p>
        <p>At 6th level, your mental discipline allows you to remain centered and deflect intrusions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.</li>
            <li><strong>Focused Deflection:</strong> When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack roll while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield, you can use your reaction to spend 1 Ki point to add your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1) to your AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 10: Steel Resolve of the Path</strong></p>
        <p>Starting at 10th level, your adherence to the disciplined path allows you to overcome adversity and pain.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unbreakable Will:</strong> When you fail a saving throw, you can expend 2 Ki points as a reaction to reroll that saving throw. You must use the new roll.</li>
            <li><strong>Ki-Fueled Resilience:</strong> When you use your Patient Defense feature (spending 1 Ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action), you also gain temporary hit points equal to your Monk level + your Wisdom modifier. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute or until depleted.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 17: The Unblinking Gaze of the Master</strong></p>
        <p>At 17th level, your focus and Ki manipulation reach a pinnacle of Tsurani discipline, allowing you to enter a state of perfect combat awareness.</p>
        <p>As an action, you can expend 5 Ki points to achieve The Unblinking Gaze for 1 minute. While in this state, you gain the following benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Truesight:</strong> You have truesight out to a range of 60 feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Perfected Strikes:</strong> Your weapon attacks (including unarmed strikes) score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</li>
            <li><strong>Overwhelming Assault:</strong> Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon, you can choose one of the following effects as part of the same attack (no additional action required by you):
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Forceful Impact:</strong> The target is pushed up to 15 feet away from you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Toppling Blow:</strong> The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) or be knocked prone.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This state of perfect focus ends early if you are knocked unconscious. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 3: Channel Divinity</strong></p>
        <p>You gain the following two Channel Divinity options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weight of Conscience:</strong> As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to target one creature you can see within 30 feet. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is overwhelmed by the psychic weight of its past misdeeds for 1 minute. While burdened, the creature has disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks, and if it attempts to move further away from you, its speed is halved. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
            <li><strong>Inescapable Verdict:</strong> As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to imbue your strikes with divine certainty for 1 minute. For the duration, your weapon attacks against any creature you have designated as your quarry (which you can do when you activate this feature by choosing one creature you can see, or one you have marked with <em>Hunter's Mark</em>) score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 7: Aura of Censure (Revised)</strong></p>
        <p>Starting at 7th level, you emanate an aura of undeniable truth while you're not incapacitated. Any creature of your choice within 10 feet of you has disadvantage on Charisma (Deception) checks. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made to discern if a creature within the aura is lying.</p>
        <p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 15: Unyielding Sentence (Revised)</strong></p>
        <p>Starting at 15th level, when you use your Divine Smite feature, you can choose for the smite's extra damage to be force or psychic damage, instead of radiant.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a weapon attack, you regain one expended spell slot. The level of the spell slot regained is equal to half the creature's challenge rating (rounded down), to a minimum of 1st level and a maximum of 3rd level. You can regain a spell slot in this way once per long rest.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 20: Avatar of Astalon's Judgment</strong></p>
        <p>At 20th level, you can use your action to become an avatar of pure, divine judgment for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain the following benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have truesight out to 60 feet.</li>
            <li>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, it takes an extra 2d8 force damage.</li>
            <li>As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can pronounce a Sentence of Condemnation upon one creature you can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your paladin spell save DC or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</li>

        <p><em>(These spells count as ranger spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.)</em></p>

        <p><strong>Level 3: Natal Attunement</strong></p>
        <p>At 3rd level, you gain the following benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You learn to speak, read, and write <strong>Natal</strong>. If you already know Natal, you learn one other standard language of your choice.</li>
            <li>You gain proficiency in the <strong>Arcana</strong> skill.</li>
            <li><strong>Rift Sense:</strong> As an action, you can open your awareness to detect planar instability. Until the end of your next turn, you know the direction and approximate distance to any active interplanar portals or rifts within 1 mile of you. Additionally, you can sense the general direction of any creature not native to the plane you are currently on within 300 feet of you. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 3: Planar Skirmisher</strong></p>
        <p>Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can choose to imbue your strike with disruptive rift energy. The attack deals an extra <strong>1d8 force damage</strong> to the target. This damage increases to 2d8 at 11th level in this class.</p>
        <p>Additionally, if the target is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend, OR if it has used planar travel or teleportation within the last minute, it has disadvantage on the first saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 7: Rift Step</strong></p>
        <p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your <strong>proficiency bonus</strong>, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 11: Unravel Anomaly</strong></p>
        <p>You can use either of the following options a total number of times equal to your <strong>Wisdom modifier</strong> (minimum of once), regaining all uses on a long rest:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Disruptive Counter:</strong> When you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell of 5th level or lower that creates a portal, summons a creature from another plane, or involves teleportation, you can use your reaction to attempt to unravel it. Make a Wisdom (Arcana) check (with proficiency if you gained it at 3rd level). The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect, and the caster takes force damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.</li>
            <li><strong>Stabilize Breach:</strong> As an action, you can touch a visible tear in reality or a minor unstable portal no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Make a Wisdom (Arcana) check (DC 15-18, set by DM). On a success, you temporarily stabilize or seal the breach for 10 minutes, preventing passage and suppressing harmful environmental effects within a 30-foot radius.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 15: Veil Walker</strong></p>
        <p>You gain the following benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have resistance to <strong>force damage</strong>.</li>
            <li>You gain a <strong>blindsight range of 10 feet</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Planar Anchor:</strong> When you hit a creature with an attack empowered by your Planar Skirmisher feature, its connection to the current plane becomes tenuous. Until the end of its next turn, its speed is halved, and it cannot take reactions. Furthermore, for the next minute, if the creature attempts to teleport or travel to another plane, it must first succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Ranger spell save DC, or the attempt fails and it wastes the action or spell slot.</li>

    <h4><strong>Roguish Archetype: Crown's Shadow</strong></h4>
    <div class="content-section">
        <p><em>(Elite intelligence operatives of the Kingdom, specializing in espionage, disguise, and information extraction.)</em></p>

        <p><strong>Level 3: Tools of the Trade</strong></p>
        <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You gain proficiency with the <strong>Disguise Kit</strong> and the <strong>Forgery Kit</strong>.</li>
            <li>You choose one of the following skills to gain proficiency in: <strong>Deception, Insight, Investigation, or Persuasion</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Agent's Scrutiny:</strong> You can use a bonus action to choose one creature you can see within 30 feet. For 1 minute, or until you use this feature on another target, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to discern its true intentions or if it is lying. Additionally, you glean hints about its current emotional state or immediate concerns (DM provides a brief, general insight). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses on a long rest.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 3: Safe Passage</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>When in an urban environment, you can attempt to hide when only lightly obscured by a crowd, street clutter, or dim light.</li>
            <li>You have advantage on ability checks to find or establish a temporary, discreet safe house in an urban area for yourself and up to your proficiency bonus in additional creatures. This safe house remains secure for 1d4+1 days before its location might become compromised.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 9: Master of Guises</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>When you use a Disguise Kit, you can create a disguise in 5 minutes (instead of 10).</li>
            <li>You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to pass yourself off as a different person while in disguise.</li>
            <li><strong>Impersonation:</strong> If you spend at least one hour observing a specific humanoid, you can make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the Wisdom (Insight) of creatures who know that individual well. On a success, you convincingly impersonate that individual's voice, posture, and general demeanor for up to 1 hour (this does not grant abilities or memories). Once you use this impersonation feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 13: Whispers of Influence</strong></p>
        <p>If you speak with a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to subtly influence its thoughts. At the end of the conversation, make a Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>If you succeed and used Persuasion:</strong> For 1 hour, you have advantage on Charisma checks directed at that creature, and it might reveal a piece of information it would normally withhold (DM's discretion).</li>
            <li><strong>If you succeed and used Deception:</strong> You plant a single, simple, plausible suggestion in the target's mind (e.g., <em>That captain seems untrustworthy, The documents are safe on the desk tonight</em>). The DM determines if and how the creature acts on this suggestion over the next 1d4 hours.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A creature immune to being charmed automatically succeeds on its Insight check. A creature that recognizes it has been influenced may become hostile or suspicious.</p>
        <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 17: Untouchable Ghost</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You cannot be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors unless you choose to be.</li>
            <li><strong>Contingency Plan:</strong> When you are reduced to 0 hit points or are subjected to an effect that would incapacitate you against your will (such as being paralyzed, stunned, or petrified), you can use your reaction to instantly become invisible, teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see, and regain hit points equal to your Rogue level + your Charisma modifier. The invisibility lasts until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</li>

        <p><em>(Your innate magic stems from a direct connection to an echo of the Valheru – the Dragon Lords, the First Beings, who rode the winds of creation and whose thoughts were fire and whose will was law. This power, ancient and terrible, now whispers in your soul, a fragment of their untamed might seeking expression through you. It is a power that demands dominance, that scoffs at the fleeting concerns of mortals, and that can reshape reality itself. To wield it is to touch the primal chaos of the dawn, to feel the beat of dragon wings in your heart, and to know the terrible freedom of near-limitless potential – and its equally terrifying cost.)</em></p>

    <h4><strong>Level 1: Echo of the Dragon Lords</strong></h4>
    <div class="content-section">
    <p>At 1st level, the ancient power within you manifests in subtle yet potent ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Draconic Speech:</strong> You learn to speak, read, and write Draconic.</li>
            <li><strong>Elemental Affinity:</strong> Choose one damage type when you gain this feature: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. When you cast a sorcerer spell that deals damage of the chosen type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.</li>
            <li><strong>Valheru Presence:</strong> You gain proficiency in the <strong>Intimidation</strong> skill. As a bonus action, you can briefly channel your Valheru heritage, manifesting a visible aura of your patron's overwhelming presence for 1 minute (this might appear as shimmering, heatless flames around you, a subtle draconic shadow briefly overlaying your own, or your eyes glowing with an ancient, golden light). For the duration, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Additionally, once while this aura is active, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you or an ally within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll as your aura flares menacingly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can activate this Valheru Presence a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h4><strong>Level 6: Wings of the First Sky</strong></h4>
    <div class="content-section">
    <p>At 6th level, you can manifest the spectral pinions of a true Dragon Lord. As a bonus action, you can cause immense, dragon-like wings formed of swirling elemental energy (matching your Elemental Affinity type, or pure force) to erupt from your back. These wings last for 10 minutes or until you dismiss them as a bonus action. While the wings are present:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have a <strong>flying speed of 40 feet</strong>.</li>
            <li>Your <strong>Elemental Affinity</strong> feature now applies to all damage rolls of spells you cast that deal your chosen damage type, not just one damage roll per spell.</li>
            <li><strong>Valheru Fury:</strong> When you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher that deals damage, you can expend 1 sorcery point to have one damage roll of the spell deal additional damage of your Elemental Affinity type equal to your sorcerer level.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you manifest these wings, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also expend 3 sorcery points to use this feature again.</p>

    <hr>

    <h4><strong>Level 14: Ancient Resilience &amp; Overwhelming Will</strong></h4>
    <div class="content-section">
    <p>At 14th level, the ancient power within you fortifies you against harm and amplifies your ability to command.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ancient Resilience:</strong> You gain resistance to your chosen Elemental Affinity damage type. Additionally, you are immune to being magically put to sleep, and you have advantage on saving throws against being paralyzed or stunned.</li>
            <li><strong>Overwhelming Will:</strong> When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you targets you or an ally within 30 feet of you with an attack or a harmful spell, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target for its attack or spell (the new target cannot be you or the original ally if they were the target), or the attack or spell fails if it cannot choose a new target or if there are no other valid targets. If the original effect targeted an area, you cannot change its point of origin, but creatures you choose within the area (up to your Charisma modifier, minimum of one) have advantage on their saving throws against it.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h4><strong>Level 18: Bond of the Dragon Lord</strong></h4>
    <div class="content-section">
    <p>At 18th level, your Valheru echo resonates with the true dragons, allowing you to forge a temporary bond of command with one such creature. As an action, you can expend 7 sorcery points and touch a willing <strong>Dragon</strong> (of a type no higher than CR 15, that has an Intelligence of 6 or more, and that can understand a language you speak, such as a Young Red Dragon or an Adult Brass Dragon, subject to DM approval for availability and willingness).</p>
    <p>For the next hour, you forge a telepathic bond with this dragon. While bonded, you and the dragon can communicate telepathically as long as you are on the same plane of existence. As a bonus action on your turn, you can give the dragon a general command (such as <em>Attack that creature, Fly us there, Guard this pass</em>). The dragon will obey your commands to the best of its ability for the duration, though it retains its own personality and might interpret commands with a degree of draconic cunning or pride. The dragon acts on its own initiative.</p>
    <p>If the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points, the bond ends, and it either dies or returns to its origin (DM's choice). The bond also ends if you use this feature again.</p>
    <p>After the bond ends, you cannot use this feature again for 7 days, unless you perform a special hour-long ritual during a long rest, appealing to your Valheru patron and expending a 9th-level spell slot (or an additional 7 sorcery points if you do not have a 9th-level slot) to regain its use sooner.</p>

        <p>Starting at 1st level:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You learn the <em>Message</em> cantrip if you don't already know it.</li>
            <li>You gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Insight, Investigation, Persuasion, or Stealth.</li>
            <li>When you make a Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can choose to roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check (you can do this after seeing the d20 roll but before the DM determines the outcome).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 1: Shadow's Embrace</strong></p>
        <p>Also at 1st level, you can use a bonus action to wreath yourself in clinging shadows for 1 minute, or until you dismiss it (bonus action), or are incapacitated. While these shadows are active:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in dim light or darkness.</li>
            <li>Once per activation of Shadow's Embrace, when a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll as the shadows momentarily deepen and obscure your form.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can use this Shadow's Embrace feature (to activate the aura) a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 6: Gaze of the Unseen</strong></p>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, as an action, you can touch a creature or object. For the next hour, you know if the target is affected by any illusion or transmutation magic, and you perceive the original form of a creature or object if it is transformed by magic. If the target is a creature, you also have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made against it to discern its true intentions or detect if it is lying.</p>
        <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 10: Corrupting Whisper</strong></p>
        <p>At 10th level, as an action, choose one humanoid you can see within 30 feet. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On a failed save, you can choose one of the following effects:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Seed of Paranoia:</strong> The target becomes intensely paranoid and suspicious of its allies for 1 minute. During this time, it has disadvantage on ability checks made to help or assist another creature, and it cannot willingly move closer to any of its allies. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unburdened Secret:</strong> The target is magically compelled to divulge one piece of hidden information or a secret it knows (DM's choice of what is revealed, but it should be relevant to the target's knowledge and the current situation). The target is unaware it has revealed this information unless it succeeds on a Wisdom (Insight) check against your spell save DC immediately after the effect ends (the compulsion lasts 1 minute for it to reveal the secret).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>On a successful save, the target is unaware that you attempted to influence it.</li>

        <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 14: Master of Shadows</strong></p>
        <p>Starting at 14th level:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can cast <em>Invisibility</em> on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot. When you cast <em>Invisibility</em> on yourself using this feature, you can also move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.</li>
            <li>Additionally, when you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.</li>

    <h4><strong>Wizard Arcane Tradition: Tradition of the Loom</strong></h4>
    <div class="content-section">
        <p><em>(Disciples of the Tradition of the Loom see the Weave of magic not as a chaotic storm, but as an infinite array of shimmering threads...)</em></p>

        <p><strong>Level 2: Initiate of the Loom</strong></p>
        <p>Beginning when you select this tradition at 2nd level:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You gain proficiency in the <strong>Insight</strong> skill and with <strong>Weaver's Tools</strong>. If you already have proficiency with Weaver's Tools, you can choose another artisan's tool.</li>
            <li>When you use Weaver's Tools as an arcane focus, you can add your proficiency bonus to one damage or healing roll of any wizard spell you cast that deals damage or restores hit points to a single target.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Level 2: Thread of Minor Illusion</strong></p>
        <p>When you cast <em>Minor Illusion</em>, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting. Additionally, you can use your bonus action on subsequent turns to alter the visual or auditory aspects of an active illusion spell you are concentrating on, provided the alteration is within the spell's original parameters (e.g., change the expression on an illusory face, shift the melody of an illusory sound, make an illusory object appear slightly worn or newer).</p>

        <p><strong>Level 6: Silken Ward of Elvandar</strong></p>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, as a reaction when you or a creature you can see within 60 feet is hit by an attack or fails a save against a spell or magical effect, you can expend one wizard spell slot to grant a bonus to the target's AC against that one attack or to their failed saving throw. The bonus is equal to <strong>1 + the level of the spell slot expended</strong>.</p>
        <p>If this feature causes an attack to miss or a save to succeed against a spell targeting only that creature, the attacker or spellcaster must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, they are charmed by the protected creature (if the effect was an attack) or by you (if the effect was a spell) until the end of their next turn.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 10: Unravel Hostile Weavings</strong></p>
        <p>At 10th level, when a creature you see (within 60ft) casts a spell (of 5th level or lower, that requires a spell attack roll or forces a saving throw), you can use your reaction to attempt to unravel it. Make an Intelligence (Arcana) check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level.</p>
        <p>On a success, you can choose one of the following effects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The creature's spell has no effect on one target of your choice (if it targets multiple creatures).</li>
            <li>One target of your choice has advantage on its saving throw against the spell.</li>
            <li>The spell's damage is halved against one target of your choice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

        <p><strong>Level 14: Master of the Elven Loom</strong></p>
        <p>At 14th level, your connection to the ancient elven way of magic deepens:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Echoes of the Elder Song:</strong> When you cast a wizard spell of 1st level or higher from the illusion or enchantment school that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can choose to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Resilient Weave:</strong> When you are concentrating on an illusion or enchantment spell, your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage unless the damage from a single source equals or exceeds your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier, or you are killed outright or otherwise incapacitated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you use either of these benefits (Echoes of the Elder Song or the special concentration protection of Resilient Weave), you can't use that specific benefit again until you finish a short or long rest, though you may use the other benefit if it is available.</p>
